# ASL-classification
This script is part of a 1-week project I carried out during a data science qualification program. The script creates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is trained to classify pictures of American Sign Language signs. The CNN is programmed using the Keras API. One-Hot-Encoding and scaling of the picture data were performed by scikit-learn (sklearn). Multiple Convolutional Neural Networks were trained using the dataset 'Sign Language MNIST' available at (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist), which contains pictures of size 28x28 depicting ASL signs representing letters of the Latin alphabet. In the end, the model with the best validation performance is tested with a separate test set.
