# ASL-classification
Convolutional neural network that classifies pictures of ASL signs
This project discusses the question whether a convolutional neural network is able to correctly classify pictures of ASL (American Sign Language) signs.
Multiple Convolutional Neural Networks where trained using the dataset „Sign Language MNIST“ (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) 
which contains pictures of size 28x28, shoowing signs,referring to letter of the Latin alphabet. In the end, the model with the best validation performance 
is tested with a separate test set.
